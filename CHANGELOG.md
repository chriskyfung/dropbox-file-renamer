## [2.1.0] - 2025-11-04

### ✨ Features

- **cli**: Add `--config` option to allow using a custom configuration file.

### ✅ Testing

- Add new test suite (`runDefaultMode.test.js`) to cover default mode execution with both default and custom configurations.

### ♻️ Refactoring

- **core**: Replace hard-coded default config file name with a `DEFAULT_CONFIG_FILE` constant.
- **core**: Move `require` of config file inside `try...catch` block to handle file not found errors gracefully.

## [2.0.0] - 2025-11-03

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

- **rename**: The syntax for backreferences in replacement strings has been changed from the standard `$1` to `{{1}}`. This is a security measure to prevent string replacement vulnerabilities. Users relying on the old backreference syntax will need to update their renaming rules.

### ✨ Features

- **rename**: Introduce a new, safer syntax for backreferences (`{{n}}`) in replacement strings to prevent potential string replacement vulnerabilities.
- **cli**: Add interactive mode for on-the-fly renaming with previews and confirmations.

### 📝 Documentation

- Update `README.md`, `GEMINI.md`, and other documentation to reflect the new `{{n}}` backreference syntax.
- Update `README.md` and all SDLC documents in `docs/` directory to reflect the new interactive feature and its usage.

### ✅ Testing

- Add a new test suite (`interactive.test.js`) for interactive workflow coverage.
- Update existing tests in `index.test.js`.

### ♻️ Refactoring

- Refactor core logic in `index.js` into `runDefaultMode` and `runInteractiveMode` for modularity.

## [1.4.0] - 2025-11-01

### ✨ Features

- **deps**: Add `re2` dependency to mitigate ReDoS vulnerabilities.
- **testing**: Add comprehensive tests for `RE2.replace` functionality.
- **testing**: Add unit tests for core functionality.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **security**: Mitigate ReDoS vulnerability by using `re2` for regex processing.
- **core**: Correct typo in '0 items to rename' console log from "reanme" to "rename".

### ⚡️ Performance

- Pre-compile rename rule regex patterns with `RE2` to improve performance.

### ♻️ Refactoring

- **main**: Encapsulate script execution in a named `main()` function to improve modularity and testability.

### ⚙️ Continuous Integration

- **dependabot**: Configure dependency grouping for npm packages and enable weekly updates for GitHub Actions.
- Add a CI workflow to automate build and test processes across multiple Node.js versions (18, 20, 22, 24).

### 🔧 Chore

- **package.json**: Enhance test scripts for granular execution (`test:all`, `test:index`, `test:re2`).

### ⬆️ Dependencies

### ⬆️ Dependencies

- Bump `dotenv` from 16.0.3 to 17.2.1.
