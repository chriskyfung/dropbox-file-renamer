# Dropbox File Renamer

This is a Node.js project that renames files in a Dropbox account using the Dropbox API v2.

**Author**: Chris K.Y. Fung

## Project Goal

The main goal of this project is to help the user batch rename files in their Dropbox. This involves two main steps:

1. Searching for files using a specific query.
2. Renaming the found files based on a regular expression replacement.

## Core Files

- `index.js`: This is the main script that contains the logic for searching and renaming files. This is the file that will be modified most often.
- `.env`: This file must be created by the user to store their Dropbox API access token. It should contain a line like `ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token`.
- `package.json`: Defines the project dependencies and scripts. The main dependency is the `dropbox` npm package.

## How to Assist the User

1. **Understand the User's Goal:** Ask the user what files they want to rename and what the new naming scheme should be.
2. **Modify `index.js`:**
    - Update the `query` variable in the `filesSearchV2` call to match the user's search criteria.
    - Update the regular expression and replacement string in the `filename.replace()` method to achieve the desired new filenames.
3. **Guide the User on Running the Script:**
    - Remind the user to create the `.env` file with their `ACCESS_TOKEN`.
    - The script is run using `node index.js` or `npm start`.

- **Provide Examples:** The `examples` directory contains scripts that demonstrate how to use the Dropbox API for searching and listing files. You can refer to these to help the user.

## Git Commits

**IMPORTANT:** All commits MUST follow the specified format. This is a strict requirement.

### Commit Message Format

**The most important rule is that all commits must be prefixed with a Gitmoji.**

The full format is:

`<emoji> <type>(<scope>): <subject>`

**Example of a good commit message:**

```
âœ¨ feat(api): implement new search endpoint
```

**Example of a bad commit message (missing Gitmoji):**

```
feat(api): implement new search endpoint
```

- **Emoji**: A relevant emoji from the [Gitmoji convention](https://gitmoji.dev/) that describes the purpose of the commit. **This is mandatory.**
- **Type**: The type of change (e.g., `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`).
- **Scope**: The scope of the change (e.g., `api`, `ui`, `db`).
- **Subject**: A short, imperative-tense description of the change.

### Commit Message Body

If the subject line is not enough to explain the change, add a more detailed description in the commit message body. The body should explain the "what" and "why" of the change, not the "how".

### Commit Message Footer

The footer can be used to reference issues, pull requests, or breaking changes. For example:

`BREAKING CHANGE: The API now returns a different data structure.`

### Atomic Commits

Each commit should be atomic, meaning it should contain a single, complete change. This makes the git history easier to read and understand. Avoid bundling multiple unrelated changes into a single commit.
