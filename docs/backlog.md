# Product Backlog

This document contains a list of potential features, improvements, and ideas for future development of the Dropbox File Renamer.

## Features

- **Search by Tags**: As a user, I want to be able to search for files based on their tags, so that I can easily find and rename files that are organized with tags.
- **Search in Multiple Folders**: As a user, I want to be able to specify a list of folders to search in, so that I can limit my search to specific areas of my Dropbox.
- **Interactive Mode**: As a user, I want to be able to run the application in an interactive mode, so that I can be prompted for the search query and renaming rules instead of editing the configuration file.
- **Support for Other Cloud Storage Providers**: As a user, I want to be able to use the application with other cloud storage providers, such as Google Drive or OneDrive, so that I can manage files across different platforms.

## Improvements

- **Improved Error Handling**: As a developer, I want to improve the error handling in the application, so that it can gracefully handle issues such as invalid access tokens or network errors and provide more informative error messages to the user.
- **Statistics**: As a user, I want to see statistics about my files, such as the number of files per tag, extension, or file size, so that I can better understand the composition of my files.

## Research/Ideas

- **AI-Powered Image Renaming**: Explore the possibility of using AI to automatically rename image files based on their content.
- **N-gram Analysis**: Investigate the use of n-gram analysis to provide more advanced file search and renaming capabilities.
